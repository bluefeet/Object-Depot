=head1 NAME

Object::Depot::Role - Expose Object::Depot as a global singleton.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Object::Depot/SYNOPSIS>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role rolls up an L<Object::Depot> into a singleton available to
all code in your application.  This role is ideal for creating global,
simplified, and centralized access to shared resources such as
connections to internal and cloud services.
